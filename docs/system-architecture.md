# 🧠 System Architecture — AIWorld Base Model

**AIWorld** is designed as a foundation for intelligent, self-sustaining automation.  
This document defines the **system architecture** — the structural and conceptual blueprint for the evolving AIWorld ecosystem.

---

## 🧩 Overview

AIWorld aims to connect three fundamental capabilities:

| Layer | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Reasoning Layer** | Interprets goals, analyzes information, and generates plans. |
| **Action Layer** | Executes automations through workflows, APIs, or local scripts. |
| **Reflection Layer** | Evaluates outcomes and uses feedback to improve behavior. |

Together, these form the system’s **Base Model** — an early prototype of a *self-evolving automation system*.

## 🏗️ Architectural Goals

1. **Self-awareness**  
   The system should understand its own state, structure, and purpose.

2. **Self-maintenance**  
   It should keep its documentation, workflows, and metadata current.

3. **Self-improvement**  
   It must reflect on its actions, evaluate outcomes, and adapt behavior.

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| `scripts/generate_readme.py` | The first automation — ensures a diff exists for testing. | ✅ Working |
| `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml` | Executes the generator and auto-commits changes. | ✅ Functional |
| `.github/workflows/auto-pr.yml` | Reflective process — proposes changes through PRs. | 🧩 Configured |

These three parts form **AIWorld’s first functional loop**:  
> _Observe → Act → Reflect._

## 🧭 Evolution Path

| Version | Focus | Description |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **v0.1** | Foundation | Establish repo, workflows, and docs. |
| **v0.2** | Intelligence | Add LLM reasoning for interpreting and modifying files. |
| **v0.3** | Adaptation | Introduce evaluation and self-adjustment logic. |
| **v1.0** | Autonomy | Fully self-reflective system capable of guided evolution. |

## 🧱 Design Philosophy

> *“The system should understand itself before it tries to improve itself.”*

- **Transparency:** Every decision is documented.  
- **Traceability:** Every improvement is measurable.  
- **Reversibility:** Every change can be undone safely.  
- **Evolution:** Progress occurs through feedback, not replacement.

---

## 🧠 Future Considerations

- Integrate AI reasoning models (OpenAI API, Anthropic, local models).  
- Introduce memory layers to preserve context between runs.  
- Develop a reflection index — a structured log of system learning events.  
- Allow dynamic prompt generation from `docs/` content.  
- Build modular specialization layers (e.g., documentation agent, code refactorer).

## 🧩 Relation to Other Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| [`Vision.md`](./Vision.md) | Defines the long-term philosophy and goals. |
| [`Home.md`](./Home.md) | Serves as the index of all project knowledge. |
| [`Roadmap.md`](./Roadmap.md) | Outlines current milestones and upcoming releases. |

## 💬 Summary

The **System Architecture** document represents the *blueprint* of AIWorld.  
It’s both a map and a mirror — showing what the system is and guiding what it will become.

> This is where automation becomes self-aware.
