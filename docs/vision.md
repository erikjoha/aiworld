# Vision â€” AIWorld

AIWorld explores what happens when **automation becomes intelligent**.

> The long-term goal is to build systems that can reason about their own purpose,  
> maintain themselves, and evolve safely.

### Core Principles
- Automation should not just *execute*; it should *understand why*.
- Systems should reflect on results and improve autonomously.
- AI should explain its reasoning in human-readable form.
